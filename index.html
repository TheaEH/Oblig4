                <h2>The Inova-team</h2>
                <p>
                    The Inova team started with a single idea. The idea was that no one should be unnable
                    to afford innovation. Taking this idea to heart and thorougly believing in it, Safiya Carelle called in her classmates 
                    Javier Bardem and Maya Anggraeni to help her develop what would become the Inova-team. A team 
                    dedicated to innovation and creative solutions for all, they fill out eachother by each serving as a 
                    critical member of the team. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Safiya Carelle is the team dreamer. She is fiercly motivated, always thinking about new ways to solve
                    problems, and is always thinking ahead.
                    She is always saying "The solution is there, we just haven't located it yet", and it is clear that
                    she firmly believes it. She is sometimes described as having hear head in the clouds, but whenever that is
                    the case, it is usually because she is dreaming up something new and exciting.

                </p>
                    Javier Bardem is the networking expert and rational thinker of the group. Firmly believing that a good deal is one
                    that provides gains for both parts, he is dedicated to connecting creative ideas from the innovation
                    camps to the business world. In his spare time he enjoys walks on the beach and fighting inequality.
                <p> 
                    Maya Anggraeni is the heart of the team and acts as the glue of the group. She is always helping Javier and Safiya
                    communicate more efficiently whenever Maya's head cooks up a difficult to do new project and Javier's cuts in with his calculated
                    mind. In the project Maya also acts as the main speaker in the innovation camps, presenting different challenges 
                    for attending students to solve and teaching them about different innovation methods.
